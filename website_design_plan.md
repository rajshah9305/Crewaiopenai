# Website Design Plan: CrewAI Agents with OpenAI API Integration

## 1. Website Purpose and Core Functionality

The primary purpose of this website is to demonstrate the seamless integration of CrewAI agents with the OpenAI API client. Users will be able to interact with a web interface to trigger CrewAI agents, which in turn will leverage the OpenAI API to perform specific tasks. The website will showcase the collaborative capabilities of multiple AI agents working together to achieve a complex goal.

**Core Functionality:**
*   **User Input Interface:** A simple web form where users can submit a prompt or a task description.
*   **CrewAI Agent Orchestration:** A backend service that receives user input, initializes CrewAI agents, and orchestrates their collaboration.
*   **OpenAI API Interaction:** The CrewAI agents will utilize the OpenAI API for various tasks, such as text generation, summarization, or code generation, depending on the agent's role.
*   **Output Display:** The results generated by the CrewAI agents (via OpenAI API) will be displayed back to the user in a clear and understandable format.
*   **Real-time Feedback (Optional):** Potentially provide real-time updates on the agent's progress.

## 2. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Outline

**UI Elements:**
*   **Header:** Website title/logo.
*   **Input Area:** A text area for user prompts and a submit button.
*   **Output Display Area:** A section to show the results from the CrewAI agents.
*   **Loading Indicator:** To inform the user that agents are processing the request.

**UX Flow:**
1.  User lands on the homepage.
2.  User enters a task/prompt into the input field.
3.  User clicks the submit button.
4.  A loading indicator appears.
5.  The backend processes the request using CrewAI and OpenAI.
6.  The results are displayed in the output area.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React (with `create-react-app` for quick setup) for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
*   **Backend:** Flask (Python) for handling API requests, orchestrating CrewAI agents, and interacting with the OpenAI API.
*   **CrewAI:** Python framework for multi-agent systems.
*   **OpenAI API Client:** Python library for interacting with OpenAI models.
*   **Deployment:** Static site hosting for the React frontend and a Python web server (e.g., Gunicorn/Nginx or a PaaS like Render/Heroku) for the Flask backend.

## 4. Data Flow Design

1.  **Frontend to Backend:** User input (text prompt) is sent from the React frontend to the Flask backend via a REST API endpoint (e.g., `/api/process_task`).
2.  **Backend to CrewAI:** The Flask backend receives the prompt, initializes the CrewAI `Crew` with defined `Agents` and `Tasks`.
3.  **CrewAI to OpenAI API:** The CrewAI agents, configured with an OpenAI LLM, make calls to the OpenAI API to perform their tasks.
4.  **OpenAI API to CrewAI:** OpenAI API returns responses (e.g., generated text) to the CrewAI agents.
5.  **CrewAI to Backend:** The final output from the CrewAI `Crew` is returned to the Flask backend.
6.  **Backend to Frontend:** The Flask backend sends the processed results back to the React frontend.
7.  **Frontend Display:** The React frontend displays the results to the user.

## 5. Project Structure (Initial Proposal)

```
./
├── frontend/             # React application
│   ├── public/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── App.js
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── ...
│   └── package.json
├── backend/              # Flask application
│   ├── app.py            # Main Flask application
│   ├── agents.py         # CrewAI agent definitions
│   ├── tasks.py          # CrewAI task definitions
│   ├── crew.py           # CrewAI crew orchestration
│   ├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
│   └── .env              # Environment variables (API keys)
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── website_design_plan.md
```

This structure separates the frontend and backend concerns, making development and deployment more manageable. Environment variables will be used to securely store API keys.
